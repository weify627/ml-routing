# Machine Learning for Routing

Exploring the use of machine learning for network routing. We look at the following two approaches:

(1) the estimation of demand matrices given previous demand history through supervised learning

    To try this method, run train_su.sh

(2) the estimation of network weights for minimal congestion routing through reinforcement
learning.

    To try this method, run train.sh
